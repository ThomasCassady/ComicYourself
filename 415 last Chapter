////////////////////// IO SYSTEMS /////////////////////

without input and output computers would be useless!

MANAGEMENT
	-important function of os
	-io devices vary greatly and new ones are being created constantly
	-device performance

DEVICE DRIVERS
	encapsulated device control interface

IO HARDWARE
	storage, transmission, human interface

	IO Signals
		Port - hardware port that connects to a device
		Bus - like signal freeway for device signals
			Daisy Chain - like freeway that goes thru each device
		Controller - like a CPU for the specific device
			eg: disk controller
			- has micro code, private memory registers

......................

Memory mapped IO
	-used for graphics eg: a 2d array of pixels

POLLING
	-waiting for io requests
	-keep checking until done
	-polling takes about 3 CPU cycles
	faster way?

-->INTERUPTS!
		CPU Interupt request line
			-one big interupt handler?
				maybe better to make separate interupt handlers
				-

APPLICATION IO INTERFACE

.......................

Higher resolution clock?
